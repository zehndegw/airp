                           AirPods were released in December of 2016 and were immediately a hit around the world. They allow you to easily take phone calls, skip or pause a song, and pick up where you left off. The headphones are wireless and come with a wireless charger that immediately charges the headphones. You can listen with either one or both headphones, as long as they're charged. AirPods are an Apple product and were launced with the iPhone 7 and the Apple Watch Series 2. If you easily lose things, don't worry! There is a ringing feature that allows you to sound an alarm to find the headphones. They truly have set the new industry standard for bluetooth headphones.
